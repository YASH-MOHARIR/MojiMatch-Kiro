# Button Click Sound Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: Audio File Not Found

### Problem
The button click sound wasn't playing because the audio file was in the wrong location.

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ Copied `btn-click.mp3` from `assets/` to `src/client/public/`
2. ✅ Added error handling and logging to audioManager
3. ✅ Added preload and event listeners for debugging

### File Locations
- **Server assets** (for Devvit splash screen): `assets/btn-click.mp3`
- **Client assets** (for in-game use): `src/client/public/btn-click.mp3`

## How to Test Now

### 1. Rebuild and Restart
```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Browser Console
1. Open the playtest URL in your browser
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Look for this message: `"Button click sound loaded successfully"`

### 3. Test Button Clicks
Click any button in the game. You should:
- ✅ Hear a click sound
- ✅ See no errors in the console

### 4. Check Console for Errors

**If you see errors, they'll tell you what's wrong:**

- `"Failed to load button click sound"` - File path issue
- `"Button click sound play failed"` - Browser autoplay policy (click anywhere first)
- `"Button click audio not loaded"` - Audio didn't initialize
- `"Error playing button click sound"` - Runtime error

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Button click audio not loaded"
**Cause:** Audio file didn't load during initialization
**Solution:** 
- Check that `src/client/public/btn-click.mp3` exists
- Rebuild: `npm run build:client`
- Restart dev server

### Issue 2: "Button click sound play failed: NotAllowedError"
**Cause:** Browser autoplay policy blocking audio
**Solution:** 
- Click anywhere on the page first to enable audio
- This is normal browser behavior for security

### Issue 3: Still no sound after fixes
**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Check browser volume (not muted)
2. ✅ Check system volume
3. ✅ Check SFX is enabled in game Settings
4. ✅ Try a different browser
5. ✅ Check console for errors
6. ✅ Verify file exists: `src/client/public/btn-click.mp3`

### Issue 4: Sound plays but very quiet
**Solution:** Increase volume in audioManager:
```typescript
// In src/client/utils/audioManager.ts
this.buttonClickAudio.volume = 0.5; // Change from 0.3 to 0.5
```

## Debugging Commands

### Check if file exists
```bash
# Windows
dir src\client\public\btn-click.mp3

# Should show the file
```

### Check file size
```bash
# Windows
Get-Item src\client\public\btn-click.mp3 | Select-Object Length
```

### Force rebuild
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Audio Manager Improvements

The audioManager now includes:
- ✅ Try-catch error handling
- ✅ Preload attribute for faster loading
- ✅ Error event listener
- ✅ Success event listener with console log
- ✅ Better error messages in console

## Expected Console Output

When the game loads, you should see:
```
Button click sound loaded successfully
```

When you click a button, you should:
- Hear the click sound
- See no errors

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. **Try incognito mode**: Ctrl+Shift+N
4. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
5. **Verify the MP3 file plays** in a media player

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - Audio file copied to correct location with improved error handling
