# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the community-driven enhancements for MojiMatcher to transform it from a single-player game into a Reddit-native community experience. These features are designed to maximize the app's competitiveness in the Reddit x Kiro Hackathon by addressing all judging criteria: Community Play, Polish, Reddit-y characteristics, and Delightful UX.

The enhancements build upon the existing MojiMatcher game (which already has basic gameplay, scoring, timer, and a simple leaderboard) to add:
1. Custom animated splash screen (required for polish)
2. Game-end emoji highlighting (UX improvement)
3. Daily Challenge Mode (community play)
4. Enhanced multi-view leaderboards (competition)
5. Achievement & badge system (progression)
6. Celebration animations & particle effects (delight)
