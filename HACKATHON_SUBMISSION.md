# MojiMatch - Hackathon Submission

## Inspiration

We were inspired by classic "spot the difference" games and the universal appeal of emojis. We wanted to create a fast-paced, addictive game that could be played directly on Reddit without leaving the platform. The idea was simple: what if we took the visual pattern recognition challenge and made it more dynamic with random rotations, sizes, and a ticking clock? We saw an opportunity to bring casual gaming to Reddit's massive community while showcasing the power of Devvit's web platform capabilities.

## What it does

MojiMatch is a lightning-fast pattern recognition game where players race against time to find the ONE matching emoji between two cards. Here's what makes it special:

**Core Gameplay:**

- Two cards appear, each displaying 8-20 emojis (depending on difficulty)
- Exactly ONE emoji appears on both cards - but it's hidden in plain sight
- Emojis have random sizes (0.7x to 2.8x) and rotations (0-360¬∞) making them look completely different
- Players have 30 seconds to find as many matches as possible
- Correct matches add time and points, wrong clicks cost precious seconds

**Key Features:**

- **4 Difficulty Modes**: Easy (8 emojis), Medium (12), Hard (16 with moving emojis), GOD (20 with faster movement)
- **Combo System**: Build streaks for massive point multipliers (up to 10x)
- **Dynamic Scoring**: 25 base points + combo bonuses (up to 115 points per match)
- **Time Bonuses**: Earn 4-13 seconds per match based on your combo level
- **60 Unique Emojis**: Faces, celebrations, games, sports, and nature themes
- **Multiple Leaderboards**: All-Time, Weekly, and GOD Mode rankings
- **Achievement System**: 13 achievements across speed, combo, accuracy, and score categories
- **Audio System**: Dynamic sound effects and music with Web Audio API
- **Mobile Optimized**: Fully responsive design for seamless play on any device

**Technical Innovation:**

- Runs natively in Reddit posts using Devvit's webview technology
- Custom animated splash screen with live leaderboard preview
- Real-time leaderboard with Redis persistence
- Seeded random generation for consistent gameplay
- Physics-based emoji positioning with overlap prevention

## How we built it

**Technology Stack:**

- **Devvit SDK**: Reddit's developer platform for native app integration
- **React + TypeScript**: Type-safe frontend with modern React patterns
- **HTML5 Canvas**: High-performance emoji rendering with transformations
- **Express**: Server-side API for leaderboard and game state
- **Redis**: Fast, persistent data storage for leaderboards and stats
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool for both client and server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom animations

**Architecture:**

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/       # TypeScript interfaces
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/   # Emojis, difficulties, achievements
```

**Development Process:**

1. **MVP Phase** (Tasks 1-12): Core game mechanics, card generation, canvas rendering, basic UI
2. **Enhancement Phase** (Tasks 13-21): Combo system, animations, audio, leaderboards, mobile optimization
3. **Polish Phase**: Bug fixes, balance adjustments, performance optimization, responsive design

**Key Algorithms:**

- **Card Generation**: Fisher-Yates shuffle with guaranteed single match
- **Overlap Prevention**: Physics-based collision detection with 60px minimum distance
- **Weighted Randomization**: Size distribution favors medium sizes while allowing extremes
- **Smart Rotation**: 20% chance of cardinal angles for visual variety
- **Seeded Random**: Deterministic generation for testing and consistency

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Canvas Rendering on Mobile**

- **Problem**: Emojis weren't appearing on mobile devices after game start
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded card width (350px) exceeded small phone screens (320px), positioning cards off-screen
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive card dimensions that adapt to screen size while maintaining aspect ratio

**2. Click Detection with Rotations**

- **Problem**: Rotated emojis had incorrect hit areas, making them hard to click
- **Root Cause**: Click detection didn't account for rotation transformations
- **Solution**: Implemented proper coordinate transformation math to handle rotated emoji bounds

**3. Emoji Overlap Issues**

- **Problem**: Emojis would overlap, making them hard to distinguish
- **Root Cause**: Random positioning without collision detection
- **Solution**: Built physics-based overlap prevention with 60px minimum distance and 50 retry attempts

**4. Game Balance**

- **Problem**: Initial 150-second timer made games too long and less intense
- **Root Cause**: Wrong assumptions about average player performance
- **Solution**: Reduced to 30 seconds with dynamic time bonuses (4-13s) based on combo level

**5. Mobile Responsiveness**

- **Problem**: Desktop layout broke on mobile, UI elements too large
- **Root Cause**: Fixed layouts and sizes not optimized for small screens
- **Solution**: Unified responsive layout using Tailwind breakpoints, percentage-based sizing

**6. Performance with 60 Emojis**

- **Problem**: Concern about performance impact with doubled emoji pool
- **Root Cause**: Initial pool of 30 felt repetitive
- **Solution**: Optimized rendering to only draw visible emojis (8-20 at a time), no performance impact

**7. Audio System Complexity**

- **Problem**: Creating engaging sounds without external audio files
- **Root Cause**: Devvit size constraints and loading time concerns
- **Solution**: Built custom Web Audio API system with oscillator-based procedural sounds
