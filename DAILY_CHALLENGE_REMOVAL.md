# Daily Challenge Feature - Complete Removal

## Summary
All Daily Challenge related code, files, and endpoints have been completely removed from the codebase.

## Files Deleted

1. **src/client/hooks/useDailyChallenge.ts** - Daily Challenge React hook
2. **src/client/components/DailyChallengeIndicator.tsx** - Daily Challenge UI indicator component

## Code Removed

### Server-Side (src/server/index.ts)

1. **Removed from `/api/stats` endpoint**:
   - Daily Challenge seed generation logic
   - Daily Challenge emoji selection
   - Daily Challenge date tracking
   - Removed `dailyChallengeEmoji` and `dailyChallengeDate` from response

2. **Deleted endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/daily-challenge` - Fetched daily challenge data
   - `POST /api/daily-challenge/score` - Saved daily challenge scores

3. **Removed Redis keys**:
   - `mojimatcher:daily:challenge:{date}` - Daily challenge data
   - `mojimatcher:daily:{date}:user:{username}` - User daily scores
   - `mojimatcher:daily:leaderboard:{date}` - Daily leaderboard
   - `mojimatcher:streak:{username}` - User streak tracking

### Client-Side

1. **Already removed in previous fixes**:
   - `isDailyChallenge` field from GameState interface
   - `dailyChallengeSeed` field from GameState interface
   - Daily Challenge mode from useGameState hook
   - Daily Challenge references from App.tsx
   - Daily Challenge props from GameOverScreen

## What Remains

The following are NOT Daily Challenge features and remain in the codebase:

1. **EnhancedLeaderboard.tsx**:
   - `dailyStreak` field in PersonalStats - This is for general daily play tracking, not Daily Challenge
   - Leaderboard tabs: All-Time, Weekly, GOD Mode (no Daily tab)

2. **Achievements System**:
   - Still functional and independent of Daily Challenge

3. **Regular Game Modes**:
   - Easy, Medium, Hard, GOD difficulty modes
   - All-Time, Weekly, and GOD Mode leaderboards

## Verification

✅ Build successful (client and server)
✅ No Daily Challenge files remain
✅ No Daily Challenge endpoints exist
✅ No Daily Challenge UI components
✅ No Daily Challenge game mode

## Next Steps

The game now operates with:
- 4 difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, GOD)
- 3 leaderboard types (All-Time, Weekly, GOD Mode)
- Achievement system
- Regular gameplay without Daily Challenge mode
