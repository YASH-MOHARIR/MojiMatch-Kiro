### Expected Gameplay

- **Play time**: 1-2 minutes (faster paced)

## Impact on Difficulty

### Easier Aspects
- ✅ Better emoji spacing (less overlap)
- ✅ More time for combos (up to +13s)

### Harder Aspects
- ⚠️ Much shorter starting time (30s vs 150s)
- ⚠️ Bigger penalty for mistakes (-2s vs -1s)
- ⚠️ Need to build combos to survive

### Strategy Changes
- **Combo building is crucial** - Need combos to get enough time
- **Accuracy matters more** - Wrong clicks are very costly
- **Fast decision making** - Less time to think
- **Risk vs Reward** - Maintaining combos vs playing safe

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test emoji overlap** - Verify emojis don't overlap visually
2. **Test time bonuses** - Verify combo time bonuses work correctly
3. **Test difficulty** - Ensure 30 seconds is challenging but fair
4. **Test timer warnings** - Verify sounds play at 10s and 5s
5. **Test color changes** - Verify timer colors change at correct thresholds
