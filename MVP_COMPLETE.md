# 🎉 MojiMatcher MVP Complete!

All 12 MVP tasks have been successfully implemented. The game is now fully playable!

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Game Mechanics
- **30 Emoji Pool**: Diverse set of emojis for variety
- **Card Generation**: Algorithm ensures exactly 1 matching emoji between 2 cards
- **Random Transformations**: Emojis have random sizes (0.8x-2.5x) and rotations (0-360°)
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas with proper transformations and styling
- **Click Detection**: Accurate emoji click detection with rotation handling

### Game Logic
- **Match Detection**: Correctly identifies when player clicks the matching emoji
- **Score System**: 25 points per correct match
- **Timer System**: 150-second countdown with +10s bonus for correct matches, -1s penalty for wrong clicks
- **Round Progression**: Automatically generates new cards after each correct match
- **Game State Management**: Tracks score, timer, rounds, and statistics

### User Interface
- **Menu Screen**: Clean start screen with instructions
- **Game Screen**: 
  - Score, timer, and rounds display
  - Canvas with two cards
  - Debug mode showing matching emoji (for testing)
- **Game Over Screen**: 
  - Final score display
  - Statistics (rounds, accuracy, best combo, total clicks)
  - Play Again and Return to Menu options

### Testing
- Automated tests for card generation
- Verification that exactly 1 emoji matches between cards
- Size and rotation range validation
- Multiple generation consistency checks

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the game**: `npm run dev`
2. **Click "Play Game"** on the menu
3. **Find the matching emoji** between the two cards
4. **Click it** before time runs out!
5. **Keep playing** - new cards appear after each correct match
